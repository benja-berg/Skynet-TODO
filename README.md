# Skynet-TODO

## Run, build, or try it out

Clone the repo, run `serve`, and visit the link shown in console.

You can build by downloading the source [here](https://siasky.net/AABNkYD4x3RRT83RL4dehtxRhVFkupTEC2oS0ViXKUsELA) and running `yarn build`.

It's also possible to try it out without building or downloading anything on [Skynet](https://vgcttdpl9vd02ohbqboa3vrmv92rqagatmkqq026qp7jrlpef8u4t4o.siasky.net/).

## Features

* MySky for JSON-storage.
* Commented out localStorage for lower latency storage - worked prior to building.
* Adding, removing, and viewing TODO's.
